## Building a Logistic Regression (Classification) Model to Predict the Likelihood of Admittance of Prospective College Students.

Hello people! I'm Goriola. This is a personal project in which I build a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of admittance of prospective college students. The raw data is a csv file (Combined Admittance Data.csv) containing information about over a hundred students seeking admission into college. The info basically includes the SAT scores of the students and their genders. Also, the admission status of each student is included.

This is what we want to achieve: Given the SAT score and gender of a student, predict whether the student will get admitted into college. I hope you enjoy my analytic style and the approach I have taken.

Cheers!
